    <h1>Reasons Why I Love Eryn More</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Written by the one and only (and Eryn's one and only), Joseph D. Rodriguez</strong>
    </p>
    <h2>Reason Number 1: I made this entire webpage for her.</h2>
    <p>
    As somebody who's never used HTML for anything outside of games, <em>learning HTML for practical, application code was annoying at best.</em> But I had my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titansrule3035/ErynsProof/main/assets/us.jpg" target="_blank">loving girlfriend</a> by my side to keep me company as I tried to wrap my head around this markup language. So to show my appreciation, I made this webpage. I hope you enjoy.
    </p>
    <h2>Reason Two: Eryn is goated in all aspects</h2>
    <p>
        In the time that I've gotten to know Eryn, I've fallen in love with many different aspects of her. Here's just a short list of the things I love the most.'
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Her eyes</li>
        <li>Her smile</li>
        <li>Her laugh</li>
        <li>Her personality (she a lot like me frfr)</li>
        <li>Her mannerisms</li>
        <li>Her voice</li>
        <li>Her fashion sense</li>
        <li>Her humor</li>
        <li>Her interests</li>
        <li>Her tenacity</li>
        <li>Her attention to detail</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If I had to choose the top four though, it would be:
        <ol>
            <li>Her smile</li>
            <li>Her laugh</li>
            <li>Her in my plans for the future</li>
            <li>Her attention to detail</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Reason Three: It just makes sense</h2>
    <p>
        As usual, the number's don't lie.
